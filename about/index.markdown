#About
We are the **E**ngineering and **C**omputer **S**cience **I**nterest **G**roup,  URI's Student ACM chapter.  We are here to provide a network of resources and support for students interested in Computer Science and Engineering.

#ECSIG Presentations
Members often volunteer to give presentations during our weekly
meetings.  These presentations typically take place in Tyler Hall room
052, or in one of the computer labs if we don't fit in 052.  
All of our slides are archived on the [ECSIG Github][github].

#Events
Every semester we host larger events like workshops and tutorials.  
Check out our [event schedule][events]!
